## Usage

To develop desktop and mobile apps for the SAFE Network install the latest [MaidSafe.SafeApp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MaidSafe.SafeApp/) package from NuGet.

This package provides support for mock and non-mock APIs. By default non-mock APIs are used in the package.

#### Using Mock API
- Mock APIs can be used by adding a `SAFE_APP_MOCK` flag in **Properties > Build > conditional compilation symbols**.
- When the mock feature is used, a local mock vault file is generated which simulates network operations used to store and retrieve data. The app will then interface with this file rather than the live SAFE network.

#### Authentication
- Applications must be authenticated via the SAFE Authenticator to work with the SAFE Network. 
- The desktop authenticator is packed and shipped with [safe_browser](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_browser/releases/latest). 
- The mobile authenticator can be found [here](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe-authenticator-mobile/releases/latest).
